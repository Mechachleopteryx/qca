# Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA)
QCA implementation including analog and digital simulations
as discussed in https://inside.mines.edu/~lcarr/theses/hillberry_thesis_2016.pdf
and https://inside.mines.edu/~lcarr/theses/vargas_thesis_2016.pdf.
Provides a simple object-oriented class for exploration and
batch simulations run in parallel with a command-line interface.

Run qca.py -h for basic help.
See qca.py for detailed usage instructions.
See states.py for details of available quantum states.
See core.py for for time evolution implementation.
See matrix.py for fundamental algorithms.
See measures.py for fundamental physics equations.
